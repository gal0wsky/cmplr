# Cmplr - shell compiling script for C & C++ files.

## Requirements:
- GCC compiler
- G++ compiler

## Usage:
- Just run the script with the source file as parameter, for example:
  
  ./cmplr.sh myCfile.c --> will make you myCfile.exe
  ./cmplr.sh myCpp.cpp --> will make you myCpp.exe

## Optional:
You can add cmplr.sh to environmental variables (Windows) / add alias to your shell (for Linux & macOS), so you can access it anywhere in your system.
